    text: Triceratops is Greek for "three-horned face," but this dinosaur actually
      had only two genuine horns; the third, a much shorter "horn" on the end of
      its snout, was made from a soft protein called keratin, the kind found in human
      fingernails, and wouldn't have been much use in a tussle with a hungry raptor
